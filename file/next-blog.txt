<h3>The language of the Modes and the Pentatonic</h3>

I've been pondering over some music theory these past few weeks. I'm still trying to learn how to improvise over chords. Learning all the patterns has been tough, so I'm trying to sort of explain stuff over this blog to better my own understanding. <br><br>

Let's backtrack a bit and look over my own musical education up to this point. I started learning around class 7 when my dad bought me a guitar, learning a bunch of stuff over YouTube and doing my best to imitate great songs like <i>Stairway</i>. This went on and off again until I got to college, where I took my first formal lesson during my first semester. Grinnell offered "free" one-on-one tutoring for international students so I thought "why not?" I really got along with the instructor, Pat "Rex" Smith, whose prowess and love for the guitar is pretty much unmatched. <br><br>

We started off with the different modes in a key and translating them into 5 distinct fingerings so encompass the entire fretboard for ease of access. Of course, let's not forget the all-purpose pentatonic scales which work wonders in any situation. It was fun, going over songs I already knew, and trying to guess how the composers derived their tunes/solos based on these scales.

Talking about my own musical education is a way for me to explain my current level and also introduce the concepts that I'm going to talk about.
