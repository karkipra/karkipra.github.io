<h3> The Dueling Ideologies of <i>El Principito</i> and <i>El Alquimista</i> </h3>

I started a reading spree during these past few weeks. Currently, I'm reading <i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert (I know, fiiiiinally). However, I'd like to focus on two other books that I read recently, both were in Spanish for the sake of my own Spanish literary desideratum.       <i>El Principito (The Little Prince) </i> and <i>El Alquimista (The Alchemist)</i> are both bound by their broad explorations of Life and Philosophy.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am in no way a Philosophy expert, in fact, I haven't even taken a Philosophy class in my life. The idea behind writing about these books is to bring myself to read more on the field and get a grasp of the author's intent.

Let's start with <i>El Principito</i>.  

	"Decididamente, las personas mayores son muy extrañas", se decía para sí el principito durante su viaje.
	"Decidedly, old people are very strange", the little prince said to himself during his travel.

From the get-go, the tale is undoubtably an introspective on the world from a child's perspective. Rather than just focus on the imaginative sensibilities and wonderment of a child, the titular prince represents the world from the elements we stop seeing when we grow up. Take the example of an elephant inside a snake, something that adults dismissively suggest to be a hat, or an alcoholic stuck in a cycle of shame and drinking. Such realities, which we fail to see from our disillusioned and clouded judgement, can be seen through clearly by the eyes of a pure being, the prince. 

<i>El Alquimista</i> follows a different narrative. Santiago, the protagonist is a traveling shepherd who is somewhat happy with his life, but yearns for more. After embarking on a wild quest to find his "Personal Legend".

	Todas las personas, al comienzo de su juventud, saben cuál es su Leyenda Personal. En ese momento de la vida todo se ve claro, todo es posible, y ellas no tienen miedo de soñar y desear todo aquello que les gustaría hacer en sus vidas. No obstante, a medida que el tiempo va pasando, una misteriosa fuerza trata de convencerlas de que es imposible realizar la Leyenda Personal.
	Everyone, from the start of their youth, knows of their Personal Legend. In this moment of life they see themselves clearly, everything is possible, and they don't fear dreaming or desiring everything which they would like to do in life. Nevertheless, as time passes, a mysterious force convinces them that it is impossible to realize thier Personal Legend. 

Santiago's journey to get to his Personal Legend, is something that all of us have experienced in our lives. What would give existence meaning, but a fancy adventure/quest? However, the truth is far more subtle than that.
