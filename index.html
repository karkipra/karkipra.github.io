								<h3> The Dueling Ideologies of <i>El Principito</i> and <i>El Alquimista</i>: June 12th, 2020 </h3>
								<br>

								I started a reading spree during these past few weeks. 
								Currently, I'm reading <i>Dune</i> by Frank Herbert (I know, finally!). 
								However, I'd like to focus on two other books that I read recently, both were in Spanish for the sake of 
								my own Spanish literary desideratum.       
								<i>El Principito (The Little Prince) </i> and <i>El Alquimista (The Alchemist)</i> are both bound by 
								their broad explorations of Life and Philosophy. <br><br>

									<div class="col-6">
											<a class="image fit"><img src="images/book2.jpg" alt=""></a>
									</div>
								</div>

								<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am in no way a Philosophy expert, in fact, I haven't even taken a Philosophy 
								class in my life. The idea behind writing about these books is to bring myself to read more on the 
								field and get a grasp of the author's intent. <br><br>

								Let's start with <i>El Principito</i>.  <br>

								<blockquote>"Decididamente, las personas mayores son muy extrañas", se decía para sí el principito durante su viaje. <br>
								"Decidedly, grown-ups are very strange", the little prince said to himself during his travel.</blockquote>
									

								From the get-go, the tale is undoubtably an introspective on the world from a child's perspective. 
								Rather than just focus on the imaginative sensibilities and wonderment of a child, 
								the titular prince represents the world from the elements we stop seeing when we grow up. 
								Take the example of an elephant inside a snake, something that adults dismissively suggest to be a hat, 
								or an alcoholic stuck in a cycle of shame and drinking. Such realities, which we fail to see from our 
								disillusioned and clouded judgement, can be seen through clearly by the eyes of a pure being, the prince. <br><br>

								<i>El Alquimista</i> follows a different narrative. Santiago, the protagonist is a traveling shepherd 
								who is somewhat happy with his life, but yearns for more. After embarking on a wild quest to find 
								his "Personal Legend". <br>

									<blockquote> Las personas, al comienzo de su juventud, saben cuál es su Leyenda Personal. En ese momento de la vida todo se ve claro, todo es posible, y ellas no tienen miedo de soñar y desear todo aquello que les gustaría hacer en sus vidas. No obstante, a medida que el tiempo va pasando, una misteriosa fuerza trata de convencerlas de que es imposible realizar la Leyenda Personal. <br>
									Everyone, from the start of their youth, knows of their Personal Legend. In this moment of life they see themselves clearly, everything is possible, and they don't fear dreaming or desiring everything which they would like to do in life. Nevertheless, as time passes, a mysterious force convinces them that it is impossible to realize thier Personal Legend. </blockquote>

								Santiago's journey to get to his Personal Legend, is something that all of us have experienced in our 
								lives. What would give existence meaning, but a fancy adventure/quest? However, the truth is far 
								more subtle than that. A person's personal legend can be defined as something that aims to
								give them a chance to take control of their own life. This is especially true given the societal
								pressures that guide each of our decisions may let us live an unfulfilling life
								(see: <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/122892/silence-mental-health-south-asian-culture-dangerous">South Asian family pressures</a>).
								I guess my point is once you're able to break that invisible barrier and make your own choices,
								you can fulfill your own Personal Legend. That being said, the path isn't always smooth. Santiago
								had to make sacrifices, got robbed, and almost gave up near the end during his journey. <br><br>

								Which brings me to the differing idealogies presented by both books. While both authors agree
								on the deconstruction of the social ideals and norms that dictate much of our lives, their main
								messages stem from different wants and desires. What does it mean - <i>to be happy, to understand the 
								inner machinations of the world around us?</i> <br><br>
								
								The Prince is a means of bringing in a character into our lives, who takes us back to 
								more simpler times, trimming down the excess complexity that "grown-ups" bring into our
								lives. How is this different from finding our Personal Legend? Well, the happinness that 
								the prince evokes was there all along, during our childhoods, when we were pure of heart, without
								the cynicisms of adulthood taking hold of us. Having your own Personal Legend means that 
								your life is somehow incomplete. I agree with the fact that both of these idealogies are not
								mutually exclusive, yet they emphasize on such different aspects of our lives. <br><br>

								I hope that this blog post makes some sort of sense and relays my understanding of these broad topics.
								Also, I would love some book reccomendations! After I finish reading <i>Dune</i>, I'm planning on reading
								<i>Cien Años de Soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude)</i>. Any book that you loved reading - let me know!

								<h3>A Fresh New Start: June 10th, 2020</h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									I guess this is my first attempt at writing a blog post. I wanted to start writing as a sort of exercise, 
									but moreover as a way of expressing myself with the world. <br>
									
									Currently, I'm in a weird situation in life. As we all know from memes, 2020 came in quick and without warning.
									Everything from Australian wildfires, COVID-19, to the protests against the abhorrent racial injustice around the world
									has been pretty impactful, to say the least. <br>

									I found myself out of a job for the summer (spoiler alert - COVID was the villain all along), after a year of dilligently applying and interviewing for internship roles
									before I start my Master's this Fall. <i>Damn, this sucks.</i> Being the goal-oriented person that I am, I hated the fact
									that I wasn't going to able to follow my plan that I had so carefully laid out. <i>The Feeling Good Handbook</i> will tell you that,
									when you are contemplating something bad to happen, it actually isn't so bad once it actually passes.  <br>

									So, where did I end up? <br>

									As I mentioned, all these seemingly catastrophic events didn't actually end up being so bad. I practically moved in with 
									my girlfriend and we've been fostering some kittens ever since then.

								<p>
									Moreover, I've taken this time to reflect back and find some stuff that I'm interested in doing.
									Hobbies and new interests take a lot of work, and I'm happy to have some free time now to read books,
									play some more guitar, take spanish video lessons, and paint. It's actually been terrific and all these
									things have done wonders to my own mental health. <br>

									Also, I found some coding work to do! It is a great program, albeit unpaid, known as <a href="https://summerofshipping.com/">Summer of Shipping</a>. 
									It is a community of developers that help interest people develop their own projects with mentors from the industry. I've joined two teams:

									<ul>
										<li>Youtube NLP: Analytics tool for Youtube videos and comments using Natural Language Processing</li>
										<li>Tattooder: React-Native app which matches users with Tattoo Artists </li>
									</ul>

									I'm excited to see how these projects develop over the course of the summer. Stay tuned for more updates!
